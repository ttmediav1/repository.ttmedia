However, The Dolphins battled back in the second quarter, scoring 17 unanswered points to narrow the margin, and at the end of the fourth quarter the teams were tied at 38-38. Despite the extreme heat and humidity, and with many players suffering the effects of dehydration, it took a further 14 minutes of overtime before San Diego kicked a winning field goal to eventually claim a 41-28 victory, and progress to the Super Bowl.</desc></programme><programme start="20191015000000" stop="20191015040000" channel="SkySportsAction.uk"><title>Live NFL</title><desc>Green Bay Packers v Detroit Lions (Kick-off 1.15am).
